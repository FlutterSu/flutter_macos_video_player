# video_player_macos

The macos implementation of [`video_player`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `video_player`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:video_player`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  video_player: ^2.0.3
  ...
```

If you wish to use the macos package only, you can add  `video_player_macos` as a
dependency:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  video_player_macos: ^0.0.1
  ...
```

[1]: ../video_player/video_player
